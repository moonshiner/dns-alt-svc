    "body": "Inspired by the conversation in issue #112: If we're concerned about the ability to add and experiment with new transports if using SvcParamKey, that may mean SvcParamKey just has a more general issue because I wouldn't expect the transports to require change particularly more often than anything else.\r\n\r\nAt issue, it seems 1 octet worth of code points for \"private use\" may not be sufficient for experimentation with new fields (or new transports if we make transports into top-level fields).  Too much chance of conflict with other uncontrolled usage of the private use block.  Seems we wouldn't really be able to use the block at all for experimental new stuff unless we constantly grease with random values from that range and the spec encourages wonky practices like always checking for a checksum in the value to ensure it's actually the param type the client is looking for.  And 2 octets is probably not enough availability overall to let anybody claim large chunks in the registered blocks for multiple experimental code points.\r\n\r\nI suggest we increase to 4 octets, make the unregistered block much larger to reduce the chances of conflicts, and encourage temporary registration of experimental parameters.  Feels to me that 4 octets would be worth it for the main extensibility mechanism of SVCB.  We'd also be able to save a bit of those octets back when params like the EsniConfig could more reasonably create new parameters for new versions instead of spending octets to do versioning within the parameter value as is the current plan."

    "body": "Instead of an \"alpn\" or \"transports\" list, perhaps each transport should be its own SvcParamKey.  Then the transport is considered supported for a record if the parameter appears in the SvcFieldValue parameter list for the record.  Maybe h1/TLS is still considered supported by default unless there's a parameter saying to not use defaults.\r\n\r\nAdvantages:\r\n- Negates the recent debates over a wire format for the transport list.  Transports are now listed in the main SvcFieldValue parameters list using the wire format established for that list.  No need to decide between delimiter separation or length prefixing for a special sub-list.  No need to create a separate string list or value registry for the transport values, as it will just be entries from the SvcParamKey registry.  The parameters will be just as easy to deal with as any other parameters for people dealing with presentation format or text config files.\r\n- Solves recent debates over potential per-transport sub parameters such as port.  Instead of a single \"port\" parameter or encoding port in transport name, transports can allocate bytes to port in the SvcFieldValue value.  This would likely be the only thing in the value for transports defined by the initial RFC, maybe with a value of 0 meaning to use the port from the qname.  Any transports added in the future could define whatever sub parameters make sense for that new transport type (or remove port entirely if non-default ports are disallowed for the new transport).\r\n- Extensibility is consistent with the primary extensibility mechanism for SVCB, that is that adding new transports or changing sub parameters format means adding to the SvcParamKey registry.  New registry additions would have all the extensible flexibility as anything else added that way."

    "body": "If decoupling from Alt-Svc, having an alternative to Alt-Used would be valuable.  This should take lessons from challenges with Alt-Used adoption and should minimize the privacy impact.\r\nSome options include:\r\n1) Send SvcDomainName \r\n2) Send SvcFieldPriority\r\n3) Send an (8? 16?) bit value specified in a new parameter\r\n4) Send a variable number of bits from a value specified in a new parameter.  (ie, client can zero-out as many MSB as it would like)\r\n\r\nI'm leaning towards (3) above as this bounds the amount of additional entropy to be significantly less than what could be done already by using an alternate port number or IP(v4/v6) address but still allows some level of signalling without requiring servers to have to go through the complexity of needing to use distinct ports/IPs (or ESNI key IDs), all of which are possible but which leak more to passive adversaries.\r\n"

    "body": "The draft originally said (prior to #66) said the Alt-Svc cache overrides HTTPSSVC. This had problems (issue #58 and #60), so #66 downgraded it to a MAY. It seems this still has problems.\r\n\r\n**HTTPSSVC vs Alt-Svc**\r\n\r\nConsider a server which uses both QUIC and ESNI. It configures both in HTTPSSVC. It also cares about HTTPSSVC-less clients (older client or legacy DNS resolver), so it configures QUIC in Alt-Svc. Is it required to configure ESNI in Alt-Svc, or can it leave things alone (with the understanding that ESNI will be limited to clients that support HTTPSSVC)?\r\n\r\nThe spec currently says a client (that would otherwise support HTTPSSVC) MAY skip an HTTPSSVC lookup given an Alt-Svc cache entry. That means, for ESNI to work, the server MUST configure it in both. This is not obvious and should be written down. More importantly, it has deployment consequences.\r\n\r\nHTTPSSVC records apply to the *current* HTTP request. If the client has no cached DNS record, it still queries DNS and gets HTTPSSVC. That means HTTPSSVC TTLs may be set more-or-less freely depending on the site's performance vs. flexibility needs. Let's say it's O(1 hour).\r\n\r\nAlt-Svc headers apply to *subsequent* HTTP requests. If the client has no Alt-Svc entry cached, it will send the HTTP request without Alt-Svc. That means Alt-Svc TTLs must cover the time to the next HTTP request for Alt-Svc to be used at all. For reference, I see google.com currently uses 30 days.\r\n\r\n**Commitments**\r\n\r\nFor the duration of the HTTPSSVC or Alt-Svc lifetime, the server operator has made a commitment to the client. ESNI is a soft commitment that the server understands this ESNI key and a hard commitment that the server is colocated with the public name. The first lower-bounds key lifetime and rotation on the server. There is a recovery mechanism, but it is expensive, so this is a soft commitment. The second is roughly a commitment to use a particular hosting provider. ESNI's retry mechanism requires the public name, so this is a hard commitment. Breaking this will knock out your site.\r\n\r\n(Note Alt-Svc without ESNI was *not* a hosting provider commitment. A provider-specific Alt-Svc may fail if the site changes providers, but the client could still connect without Alt-Svc. ESNI must take this fallback away to prevent network downgrade.)\r\n\r\nHTTPSSVC and Alt-Svc commitment timescales are qualitatively different. Saying ESNI servers must advertise in both, as implied by the spec today, means servers must incur a long-lived hosting provider commitment to deploy ESNI at all. (Or send no Alt-Svc headers and lose QUIC on non-HTTPSSVC clients.) It also means ESNI keys must be long-lived, which makes them more sensitive.\r\n\r\n**Proposed fix**\r\n\r\nGiven the above, I don't see how allowing Alt-Svc to override HTTPSSVC is tenable. That suggests changing the spec so a client that makes HTTPSSVC queries makes them even if Alt-Svc is available. If it gets an HTTPSSVC record, it ignores Alt-Svc and uses those instead. Otherwise, it may freely use Alt-Svc.\r\n\r\nThis is fussy because Alt-Svc itself allows replacing the origin hostname with an alternate name. Clients would likely want to query the alternate's A/AAAA records, the origin's A/AAAA records, and the origin/s HTTPSSVC records in parallel. However, the alternate may leak ESNI, so the alternate connection must wait for whether HTTPSSVC aborts it before proceeding past that query.\r\n\r\nThat adds *even more* complexity to the prospect of actually implementing remote Alt-Svc. Personally, I think all these name indirections are seeming more and more like a mistake and questionably worthwhile.\r\n\r\n**Whither ESNI in Alt-Svc?**\r\n\r\nWith the above, it is no longer strictly necessary to allocate a way to spell ESNI in Alt-Svc. I don't know whether we still want to. This issue means ESNI in Alt-Svc is very different from ESNI in HTTPSSVC. At minimum, we must clearly call out the implications of the longer lifetime in the spec. We could decide this is not worth the trouble. On the other hand, it's likely a number of clients won't make HTTPSSVC queries for some time, and perhaps those clients getting ESNI for the subset of servers willing to make a longer-term public name commitment is worthwhile.\r\n\r\n**Parting thought**\r\n\r\nI think a lesson here is we cannot completely abstract ESNI from its delivery mechanism. Pulling ESNI into HTTPSSVC is reasonable so we only have one record to query, but HTTPSSVC's decisions still have implications for ESNI.

I think we should only allow one value per parameter.\r\n\r\nThis means duplicate values can be rejected generically in the parser. Right now the spec says individual parameters silently ignore all but the first value. Silently ignoring things isn't great. Other protocols like Roughtime further require keys be sorted, which makes it easy for the parser to reject duplicates generically.\r\n\r\nThis also avoids questions when designing a new parameter as to whether to use multiple parameter values or to encode multiple structures in the value. We should have one way to do things, so let's use the latter."

    "body": "Currently, if a server publishes a QUIC-only HTTPSSVC RRSet with ESNI, there is no way for a client to fall back to a non-QUIC connection, because doing so would reveal the SNI.  This could increase the likelihood of partial outages for server admins who haven't considered the small fraction of users whose network path does not support QUIC.\r\n\r\nReviewers have reported concerns that this creates an undesirable level of fragility.  We should consider whether there is an alternative design that would be less likely to result in accidental breakage."

    "body": "Currently, in-band Alt-Svc always has precedence over HTTPSSVC, and the presence of a cached Alt-Svc is supposed to disable the HTTPSSVC query altogether.  However, this could be a problem for Chrome.\r\n\r\nChrome currently implements only \"local Alt-Svc\", i.e. Alt-Svc where the origin hostname is empty.  All other Alt-Svc headers are ignored.\r\n\r\nConsider a site hosted in a multi-CDN configuration, using QUIC on both CDNs.  Currently, that site could send a header like `h3=:443`, and Chrome would upgrade to QUIC.\r\n\r\nNow suppose that both CDNs support ESNI.  The site could send additional Alt-Svc headers like `h3=cdn1.example:443; esnikeys=ABC...` and `h3=cdn2.example:443; esnikeys=123...`, but Chrome would ignore both of these, so Chrome users would get QUIC but not ESNI.\r\n\r\nIf some Chrome users can query HTTPSSVC, those users could get the full package for ESNI through the DNS.  However, the presence of `h3=:443` in the Alt-Svc cache would prevent them from even doing the HTTPSSVC query (in the current draft).\r\n\r\nA straightforward solution here would be to declare that the precedence of HTTPSSVC vs. Alt-Svc is implementation-defined.  This might reduce the ability of origins to fine-tune suboptimal HTTPSSVC, but it gives clients more flexibility to do what makes sense for them."

(No changes needed.)\r\n- Clarify that recursives should be able to treat key types as opaque.\r\n\r\n- Remove the \"esnikeysref\".  (But perhaps move it back to an issue.)   Helpful for separating operational management, but pull this out for now.\r\n    - Having an authoritative feature for copying this into place might be cute down-the-road but not needed here.\r\n\r\n- Remove general parameter type specifications.\r\n\r\n- Ben: remove the \"can ignore\" optimization.  (That Ben added in)\r\n\r\n- Bike shed: what to name the records.   Keep with them for now, and get consensus later on what to rename them with.\r\n  - SVCB            (later to ???)\r\n  - HTTPSSVC   (later to HTTPS or SVCHTTPS ?)\r\n\r\n- For delimiters between parameters and their encoding:\r\n  - Just leave delimiter as space.  \r\n  - Copy over or reference string quoting from TXT record RFC (or some similar but more recent RFC)\r\n"

It should be:\r\n\r\nexample.com.      7200  IN HTTPSSVC 0 0 svc.example.net. “”\r\n\r\nSimilarly in 2.4.  HTTPSSVC records: alias form\r\n\r\nAlso don’t use 2H for the TTL.

It is there, just not as up-front as it could be.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt might be a little clearer if the list of alt-svc values (h2, h3, etc) that can occur were to be listed in the document. In particular, the association between h3 and QUIC is inferred but not explicitly called out (at least not that I noticed.)\r\n"
